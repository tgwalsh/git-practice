# Mixed Messages - Portfolio Assignment

:writing_hand: **Assignment:** Build a Node.js console app that generates random messages each time a user runs the program. I also needed to version my project with Git/GitHub.

## Project Objectives :white_check_mark:

- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

### Prerequisites:

- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line

## My idea :thought_balloon:

I wanted to create a generator that would provide the user a daily drawing prompt. This prompt provides a random person/place/thing with an action. It also suggests a color to feature within the drawing.

I set the variables to arrays that hold the nouns and verbs for the prompt. I then created 2 functions to randomly select a word from each array. One for the noun and another for the verb.

I created another function that randomly generates a hex value for the color.

And lastly, a function to log a string with the text that calls the noun, verb and color.

Example:
For todayâ€™s drawing, draw a boogeyman that is painting. Try to incorporate #34c9fb as the main color of your design. :zombie: :paintbrush:
